<h2> What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS? </h2>
<ol>
  <li>HTTP <ul>
      <li>Unsecured</li>
      <li>Sends data over port 80</li>
      <li>No SSL certificates are required</li>
      <li>Operates at application layer</li>

<ol>
  <li>HTTPS <ul>
       <li>Secured</li>
       <li>Uses port 443</li>
       <li>Operates at transport layer</li>
       <li>Required to have a SSL certificate and CA signs it</li>
