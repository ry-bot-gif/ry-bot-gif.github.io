<h2 style="background-color:DeepSkyBlue;">Define Internet Backbone</h2>
<p style="background-color:DarkTurquoise;"><em>Internet backbone</em> is the core of the internet. It <strong>connects all</strong> computer networks and routers of the internet. The <em>Internet backbone</em> helps the largest and fastest networks link together with fiber-optic connections and high-performance routers.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:CornflowerBlue;">What is the difference between clients and servers on the internet?</h2>
<p style="background-color:DarkCyan;"> A server is a sample of software or hardware that serves a specific service to its clients. A client is a user program that connects to a server to access a service. </p>

<h2> Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms</h2>
<p> The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into <em>four abstraction layers</em>, which classify all related protocols according to each protocol's scope of networking </p>

<h2> List at least three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships. </h2>
<p> Emailing, network printing, and the World Wide Web. </p>

<h2> What is Hypertext? </h2>
<p>Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references/links to other texts that the reader can immediately access with a single click.</p>

<h2> How is <strong>“the web”</strong> related to the internet? </h2>
<p> The Internet, linking your computer to other computers around the world, is a way of transporting content. <em>The Web</em> is software that lets you use that content or contribute your own. </p>

<h2> Explain how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to facilitate client/server interaction. </h2>
<p> How HTTP works. Through the HTTP protocol, resources are exchanged between client devices and servers over the internet. Client devices send requests to servers for the resources needed to load a web page; the servers send responses back to the client to fulfill the requests. </p>

<h2> What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS? </h2>
<ol>
  <li>HTTP <ul>
      <li>Unsecured</li>
      <li>Sends data over port 80</li>
      <li>No SSL certificates are required</li>
      <li>Operates at <strong>application</strong> layer</li>

<ol>
  <li>HTTPS <ul>
       <li>Secured</li>
       <li>Uses port 443</li>
       <li>Operates at <strong>transport</strong> layer</li>
       <li>Required to have a SSL certificate and CA signs it</li>

<h2>Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 generational paradigms.</h2>
<p> Web 1.0 was all about fetching, and reading information. Web 2.0 is all about reading, writing, creating, and interacting with the end user. It was famously called the participative social web. Web 3.0 is the third generation of the World Wide Web, and is a vision of a decentralized web which is currently a work in progress. It is all about reading, writing, and owning.</p>

<h2> Describe the role markup languages play in the Web. </h2>
<p> HTML or HyperText Markup Language, is thhe most basic building block of <em>"The Web"</em>. It defines the meaning and structure of web/internet content. </p>

<h2>Compare and contrast markup and scripting languages</h2>
<p> <strong>Differences:</strong> One difference is that markup languages are primarily used for formatting text and data, while scripting languages are used for creating executable programs. 
Markup languages are also generally easier to learn and use than scripting languages. This is because markup languages are simpler and do not require complex logic or problem-solving skills. Both types of languages use tags or keywords to identify elements within their code.

 <strong>Similarites: </strong>Both can be used in conjunction with one another to create web pages or applications.</p>

 <h2> Explain the relationship between Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML), and markdown (MD).</h2>
 <p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a cousin to HTML and a nephew to SGML. Although XML is a markup language and therefore part of the family, it has different functions than HTML. XML is a subset of SGML, which gives it rights that an application, such as HTML, does not have. XML can define applications of its own. </p>
